            <h3>Game Logic</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Two human players or One Human Player and One AIBot</li>
                <li>Game can have multiple rounds and this will be saved in round numbers and number of wins for each player</li>
                <li>3 x 3 Grid with clickable buttons that are numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 </li>
                <li>Two Markers, Marker 1: X,  Marker 2: O</li>
                <li>Players, play turn by turn and game will be over after maximum of 9 turns either in a draw or in a win</li>
                <li>First player to get 3 of the same mark on a straight line will be the winner before the 9 turn are up according to the following conditions;</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Conditions for wins</h4>
                <p>Straight Line: All three Row wins:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1,2,3</li>

                <h4>Conditions for Draw</h4>
                <p>Anything that is not in the above win conditions will be a draw</p>


                <h3>Main Coding rules</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use Object oriented design to create the game and no global variables, store all the the variables inside factories.</li>
                        <li>Main goal here is to have as little global code as possible.</li>
                        <li>If only a single instance of something is required (e.g. the gameboard, the displayController etc.) then wrap the factory inside an IIFE (module pattern) so it cannot be reused to create additional instances.</li>
                        <li>Decide on which Objects to store the relevant logic so code is easily maintainable</li>
                        <li>First create a working game on the browser console. Test and after making sure the game work start work on the User interface</li>
                        <li>Create a User interface which display game status, input player choices, reset game, add player name, show player score</li>

                    </ul>

                <h3>User Interface design (HTML and CSS)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Game board 3x3 Grid using buttons with id's assigned to grid numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9</li>
                        <li>Display Player 1 Name</li>
                        <li>Display Player 2 Name</li>
                        <li>Display Round Number</li>
                        <li>Display No of wins Player 1</li>
                        <li>Display No of wins Player 2 or AiBot</li>
                        <li>Two radio buttons to select Game Type: 1 Player and AiBot, 2 Players </li>
                        <li>Submit Button to set the game type from above radio buttons</li>
                        <li>Text Box to Enter Player 1 Name</li>
                        <li>Only visible if it is two human players: Text Box to Enter Player 2 Name</li>
                        <li>Button to Submit Player Names</li>
                        <li>Reset Button to reset the game and clear the screen</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                <h3>Logic design(JavaScript)</h3>
                <p>Code will be broken up into the Objects as follows;</p>

                        <li>Get the position player has selected and store the value as two values of Row number and column number i.e. [1, 4, X] with the Marker</li>
                        <li>Store the gameboard as an array inside this object: playerOneArray, playerTwoArray, playerOneDetails, playertwoDetails</li>
