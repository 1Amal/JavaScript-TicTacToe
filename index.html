            <h2>Tic Tac Toe Game Architecture</h2>
            <h3>Game Logic</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>One Human Player and One AIBot</li>
                <li>Game can have multiple rounds and this will be saved in round numbers and number of wins for each player</li>
                <li>3 x 3 Grid with clickable buttons that are numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 </li>
                <li>Two Markers, Marker 1: X,  Marker 2: O</li>
                <li>Players, play turn by turn and game will be over after maximum of 9 turns either in a draw or in a win</li>
                <li>First player to get 3 of the same mark on a straight line will be the winner before the 9 turn are up according to the following conditions;</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Conditions for wins</h4>
                <p>Straight Line: All three Row wins:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1,2,3</li>
                        <li>4,5,6 </li>
                        <li>7,8,9</li>
                    </ul></p>


                <p>Straight Line: All three Column wins
                    <ul>
                        <li>1,4,7</li>
                        <li>2,5,8</li>

                <p>Straight Line: All three Diagonal wins
                    <ul>
                        <li>1,5,9</li>
                        <li>3,5,7</li>
                    </ul>

                </p>

                <h4>Conditions for Tie/Draw</h4>
                <p>Anything that is not in the above win conditions will be a draw/Tie after all 9 grid slots have been filled</p>


                <h3>Main Coding rules</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use Object oriented design to create the game and no global variables, store all the the variables inside factories.Main goal here is to have as little global code as possible.</li>
                        <li>If only a single instance of something is required (e.g. the gameboard, the displayController etc.) then wrap the factory inside an IIFE (module pattern) so it cannot be reused to create additional instances.</li>
                        <li>Decide on which Objects to store the relevant logic so code is easily maintainable</li>
                        <li>First create a working game on the browser console. Test and after making sure the game work start work on the User interface</li>
                        <li>Create a User interface which display game status, input player choices, reset game, add player name, show player score</li>

                    </ul>

                <h3>User Interface design (HTML and CSS)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Game board 3x3 Grid using buttons with HTML id's assigned to grid numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9</li>
                        <li>Display Player 1 Name & No of wins</li>
                        <li>Display AiBot Name & No of wins</li>
                        <li>Display Round Number</li>
                        <li>Text Box to Enter Player 1 Name</li>
                        <li>Button to Submit Player1 Name</li>
                        <li>Reset Button to reset the game and clear the screen</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                <h3>Logic design (JavaScript)</h3>
                <p>Code will be broken up into three Objects as follows for code readability and memory efficiency;</p>        
                
                <h4>gameMemory: Used only as a memory to store the player positions, player details, player statistics, etc..</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Variable for Player:
                            let playerName="";
                            const playerMarker="X";
                            let playerScore=0;
                            let playerWins=0;
                            let playerTurns=[];
                        </li>
                        
                    
                        <li>Variables for AiBot
                            const aiBotName="AiBot";
                            let aiBotScore=0;
                            let aiBotWins=0;
                            let aiBotTurns=[];
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Variables to store other data
                            let roundNo=0;
                        </li>
                    


                        <li>Object to track whether game board grid is empty or not gameBoard:{1:"empty",2:"empty",3:"empty",4:"empty",5:"empty",6:"empty",7:"empty",8:"empty",9:"empty"}</li>
                        <li>Assign a 3x3 grid based naming convention and store it in an boarArray  i.e. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</li>
                        <li>Get the position player has selected and store the value in "playerBoardPosition" of player1 and AiBot to see who won and "gameBoard" so game can keep track of used and free grid slots</li>
                        <li></li>

                    </ul>

                        <li>Check for Game win</li>
                        <li>Check for Game Ties</li>
                        <li>Keep track of player and computer Marker (i.e. O X)</li>
                        

                    </ul>
                <h4>displayController: Only function is to check player 1 inputs then store to the gameMemory and update the display with data stored in the gameMemory to update the HTML Dom and to received user input</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Listen for user clicks in the 9 grids</li>
