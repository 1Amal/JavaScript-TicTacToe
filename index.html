<h2>Tic Tac Toe Game Architecture</h2>
<h3>Game Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Two human players or One Human Player and One AIBot</li>
    <li>Game can have multiple rounds and this will be saved in round numbers and number of wins for each player</li>
    <li>3 x 3 Grid with clickable buttons that are numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 </li>
    <li>Two Markers, Marker 1: X,  Marker 2: O</li>
    <li>Players, play turn by turn and game will be over after maximum of 9 turns either in a draw or in a win</li>
    <li>First player to get 3 of the same mark on a straight line will be the winner before the 9 turn are up according to the following conditions;</li>
</ul>



<h4>Tic Tac Toe Board Coordinates;</h4>

    <table class="boardInfo">
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>6</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>9</td>
        </tr>
    </table>



<h4>Conditions for wins</h4>
<p>Straight Line: All three Row wins:
    <ul>
        <li>1,2,3</li>
        <li>4,5,6 </li>
        <li>7,8,9</li>
    </ul></p>


<p>Straight Line: All three Column wins
    <ul>
        <li>1,4,7</li>
        <li>2,5,8</li>
        <li>3,6,9</li>

    </ul>
    
    
    

</p>

Straight Line: All three Diagonal wins
    1,5,9
    3,5,7

Rest of the combination will be a draw

***Main Coding rules***

* Use Object oriented design to create the game and no global variables, store all the the variables inside factories.
* Main goal here is to have as little global code as possible.
* If only a single instance of something is required (e.g. the gameboard, the displayController etc.) then wrap the factory inside an IIFE (module pattern) so it cannot be reused to create additional instances.
* Decide on which Objects to store the relevant logic so code is easily maintainable
* First create a working game on the browser console. Test and after making sure the game work start work on the User interface
* Create a User interface which display game status, input player choices, reset game, add player name, show player score

***User Interface design (HTML and CSS)***
* Game board 3x3 Grid using buttons with id's assigned to grid numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
* Display Player 1 Name
* Display Player 2 Name
* Display Round Number
* Display No of wins Player 1
* Display No of wins Player 2 or AiBot
* Two radio buttons to select Game Type: 1 Player and AiBot, 2 Players 
* Submit Button to set the game type from above radio buttons
* Text Box to Enter Player 1 Name
* Only visible if it is two human players: Text Box to Enter Player 2 Name
* Button to Submit Player Names
* Reset Button to reset the game and clear the screen

***Logic design(JavaScript)***
Code will be broken up into the Objects as follows;

gameBoardObject
Used to store the player positions in an array
* Assign a 3x3 grid based naming convention for  i.e. Rows:1 2 3 Columns:4 5 6
* Get the position player has selected and store the value as two values of Row number and column number i.e. [1, 4, X] with the Marker
Store the gameboard as an array inside this object; 
playerOneArray, playerTwoArray
playerOneDetails, playertwoDetails


playerObject": Store players in an object called 


gameControlFlow" : Object to control Flow of the game (Check winning condition, Keep track of number of turns, )
* Start Game
* Check for Game score
* Check for Game win
* Check for Game Ties
* Keep track of player and computer Marker (i.e. O X)

displayController": Object to update the HTML Dom and to received user input
* Receive input from the player
* Display game status on the display
* Button to change name
* Button to Restart game
* Game result display element


playerObject
* Able to save details of two players
* Player 1 Array: Name, Score, Selected grid locations
Used to store the Player name, Score in an array
* Create new players
* Delete players
* Has a aiBot which can pay with the Human player

Pseudo Code
* Page load
